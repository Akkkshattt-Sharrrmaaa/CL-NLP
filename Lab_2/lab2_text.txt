In twilight's embrace, whispers weave,
Stars dance upon the velvet sleeve.
Moonbeams paint dreams in hues of night,
Where shadows waltz in soft moonlight.

A symphony of silence, the earth's gentle sigh,
Echoes of love in a vast, azure sky.
Time melts away in the river's flow,
As souls entwine where wild roses grow.

Beneath the canopy of dreams, we stray,
In the realm where hearts forever sway.
